I've been getting into pinball quite a bit lately. While I don't currently own a machine, I like to use [Pinball Map](http://pinballmap.com/) to search for tables that I'm interested in playing. Personally, the arcade hunt also serves as a reason to travel and see more of the world. Two birds with one stone :)

I also play a bit on simulators like The Pinball Arcade and Pinball FX3. The experience is not the same, but certainly much cheaper.

I started off playing Yu-Gi-Oh!, but ultimately transitioned to Magic: The Gathering. I really enjoy the deck building aspect of TCGs, which inspired me to create [Combo Chance](http://combochance.sudicode.com) â€” a tool that calculates the probability of drawing a combo in an opening hand (for any TCG).

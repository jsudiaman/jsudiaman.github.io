<a href="/images/iwritecode.jpg" data-featherlight="image">I write code!</a> I develop mainly in Java, Python, and JavaScript. I possess an open mind with an eagerness to learn new technologies. My philosophy is that with a good grasp of the <a href="/images/fundamentals.png" data-featherlight="image">fundamentals</a>, one should be able to adapt quickly in the advent of new languages, frameworks, libraries, etc.

I'm proud to hold a B.S. degree in Computer Science from [Wentworth Institute of Technology](https://wit.edu), as well as a certification from Oracle ([OCAJP 8](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/edb762b0-efac-4118-ab22-76e03d184b50/public_url)). Most notably, I've attained the highest GPA (3.94) out of all CS majors in my graduating class at WIT.

I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer for [CommScope](http://www.commscope.com).

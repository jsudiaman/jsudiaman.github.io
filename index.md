[I write code!](images/iwritecode.jpg) I develop mainly in Java, Python, and
JavaScript. I possess an open mind with an eagerness to learn new technologies. My philosophy is that with a good grasp
of the [fundamentals](images/fundamentals.png), one should be able to adapt quickly
in the advent of new languages, frameworks, libraries, etc.

I'm proud to hold a B.S. degree in Computer Science from [Wentworth Institute of Technology](http://wit.edu), as well as
a certification from Oracle ([OCAJP 8](http://www.youracclaim.com/badges/edb762b0-efac-4118-ab22-76e03d184b50)). Most
notably, I've attained the highest GPA (3.94) out of all CS majors in my graduating class at WIT.

I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer for <a href="http://www.commscope.com">CommScope</a>.
